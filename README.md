# karpathy-tutorials
My Colab Notebooks from following Andrej Karpathy's "Neural Networks: Zero to Hero" series on Youtube.

Some of these may look line-for-line like his code - that's because I typically copied his code line-for-line, as is the nature of watching tutorials.
The purpose of this repository is just to track my progress with the series and demonstrate that I have indeed watched & completed it.
